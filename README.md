Using provided data on age, number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and a few others to predict the likelihood of diabetes in women in India using logistic regression as well as random forest classification. 

I also took a look into the data's correlation between features and diabetic outcomes and delta between the mean of each features for diabetic and non-diabetic women, among other things. This can be found in the "Diabetes Data Visualization" file.
