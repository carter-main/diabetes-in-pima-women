# diabetes-in-women
Using provided data on age, number of pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and a few others to predict the likelihood of diabetes in women of Pima Indian heritage using logistic regression as well as random forest classification. This can be found in the "Predict Diabetes Logistic Regression & Random Forest Classifier" file.

I also took a look into the data's correlation between features and diabetic outcomes and delta between the mean of each features for diabetic and non-diabetic women, among other things. This can be found in the "Diabetes Data Visualization" file.

Finally, I found which of the features had statistical significance when it came to diabetic women vs those without diabetes. This can be found in the file titled "Two-Sample T-Test For Characteristics Of Diabetic And Non-Diabetic Women".
